### Note: The source code is written in c++ only, but still the explaination of all the patterns nad principle in not language specific.
Also would appreciate if someone is willing to contribute to this repo, by maybe providing the source code for the given examples in some different languages. Lastly, in case you spot some bug or some mistake made by me than feel free to raise a issue, it would be very helpful for me to spot bugs or mistakes in case if there are any.
